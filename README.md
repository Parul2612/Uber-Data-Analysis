# Uber-Data-Analysis
The first step is to use exploratory data analytics on the dataset to look for information that was previously unknown or hidden, and then to see how each field affects price in relation to the other fields in the dataset. The analysis is then completed using various machine learning models.
## Dataset
For this project we have taken the dataset from [uber](www.uber.com) which is in csv format and it was recongfigured to reflect the important features.
## Required Packages
The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook with a Python 3.6 kernel, and in addition it requires the following packages:
