# Uber-Data-Analysis
The first step is to use exploratory data analytics on the dataset to look for information that was previously unknown or hidden, and then to see how each field affects price in relation to the other fields in the dataset. The analysis is then completed using various machine learning models.
## Dataset
For this project we have taken the dataset from [uber](www.uber.com) which is in csv format and it was recongfigured to reflect the important features.
## Required Packages
The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook with a Python 3.6 kernel, and in addition it requires the following packages:
- Numpy 
* Pandas 
+ Matplotlib 
* Seaborn (version: 0.6.0)
- sklearn
## Application
Companies will be able to comprehend the background of various operations through the analysis. Understanding complex data and gaining insights that can assist businesses in making decisions are advantages.
This data visualization will help to understand the data and get a sense of pricing background for the people who take the trips.
